Project Demo video: [Demo](https://pages.github.com/) 

Implemented additional features from the “Advanced” section: 
1. I used programmatic AutoLayout + SnaKit in my project. :triangular_ruler:
2. Implemented skeleton views using SkeletonView framework.💀
3. Made the user interface convenient for most screen sizes. :iphone:
4. Made the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs. :arrow_up_down:
5. Made images caching and reusable using the NSCache class. ⌛
6. Used “nice” namings for methods, properties, write marks for code sections. ✅
7. I used MVC architecture in this project. (Not perfect MVC, but tried to comply :grimacing:) 
8. Tried to write safe code :shield:
9. Made the “Capital coordinates” latitude + longitude value on the CountryDetails screen tappable :world_map:
